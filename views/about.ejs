            <h3>PATH AHEAD</h3>
            <p>Even though some initial success towards fulfilling our mission objectives has been achieved but still a lot much has to be done and thus Charity For Humanity aims to accomplish the goals ahead in the near future which are :<ul><li>To remove the economic barriers that mothers face who are seeking post-secondary education; we will assist them with the costs of childcare, transportation, education, and emergency events. </li>
              <p><li>To invest in the development of our clientsâ€™ children. In addition to partnering with quality childcare agencies, we will provide assistance so that kids may engage in extracurricular activities. Parents in our program may receive assistance in providing school supplies and other necessities for their children. Through our efforts to support child development, we hope to break the cycle of generational poverty.</li></p>
              <p><li>To generate employment for beggers by hiring them for jobs like garbage collection, to be done with government support. This would also serve to maintain their self-esteem and they won't be dependent on anyone for anything.</li></p></ul></p>
